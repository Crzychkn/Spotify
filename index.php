   <h1>Breaking Down The Journey</h1>
</div>

<div id="introText">
   <p>Spotify is the world’s largest ad-supported streaming music service. As of June 2017, there are over 140 million active listeners listening to a database of over 30 million songs across 60 countries. Mobile devices are the most common platform for listeners to access Spotify at 52% of the overall use (Spotify Media Kit 2018). With this increasing reliance on the mobile platform it is crucial that Spotify succeeds at presenting an exceptional experience for listeners.</p>
<br>
<p>Spotify listeners access the service from morning to night. Listeners use their mobile device, personal computer or connected device as they go through their morning routine, commute throughout the day, work, study at school, run errands, play or party on the weekends, and wind down each night. Every one of these uses presents a different scenario of environment and behavior.</p>
<br />
<p>With the average listener accessing the app for more than two hours each day, it is expected that they become familiar with the app and expect smooth interactions. Gestures play a large role in achieving this familiarity and effortless interactions.</p>
<br />
<p>With a wide variety of options, there are specific gestures in Spotify which represent customer actions. Through a careful study of use case scenarios and research, our goal as a research team was to determine if the gestures in the Spotify app are effective and provide an excellent customer experience.</p>
</div>


<div id="gestureIntro">
   <h1>Gesture Study Introduction</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureIntroText">
<p>During our exploration of the Spotify mobile app, we determined how the app utilizes gestures.</p>
<br>
<p>We wanted to know if Spotify implements gestures appropriately, whether they are easily discoverable, and if these gestures truly enhance the listener’s experience. We also provided suggestions on ways Spotify can improve its implementation of gestures.</p>
<br>
<p>Gestures within Spotify change how the listener interacts with the application and their music. Gestures are an essential component for navigating through Spotify and accomplishing the listener’s needs. Understanding how gestures affect usage are of the utmost importance because it influences the Information Architecture of the application.</p>
<br>
<p>By doing this deep-dive study into gestures, we hope to be able to design better mobile applications, websites, and other digital products that take advantage of touch screens in the future.</p>
</div>
  

<div id="gestureProcess">
   <h1>Gesture Study Process</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureProcessText">
<p>We conducted our research through a few different phases. We started by doing some discovery research through individual use, notating our findings. After becoming more familiar with the mobile app on our personal devices we discussed our findings with each other and did a group study on the provided flagship devices, the iPhone 8 and the Pixel 2.</p>
<br>
<p>We examined the similarities and differences between not only the devices but the operating systems as well. During this comparison we took inventory of all the gestures that Spotify uses on the platforms we tested.</p>
<p>The next step in our research study was to run through some use cases and document our findings. We created three use cases:</p>
<br>
<ul class="gestureLists">
<li>listener creates a playlist</li>
<li>listener edits a playlist</li>
<li>listener shares a playlist</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>Through our process we came up with several deliverables. Although it was a team effort, each deliverable had specific people ultimately responsible for them. The list of deliverables and their owners is as follows:</p>

   <h1>Goals of Study</h1>
</div>

<div id="studyGoalsText">
<p>We think that gestures can help listeners efficiently perform tasks and that they should enhance their musical experience. We set out to determine whether Spotify implements gestures appropriately, whether they are easily discoverable, and if these gestures truly enhance the listener’s experience.</p>
<br>
<p>We predicted that gestures do enhance the experience, many gestures within Spotify are not easily discoverable, and Spotify could implement gestures better in certain places within their app.</p>
<br>
<p>With this study we also wanted to understand how gestures affect the usage of the application and how gestures affect listener behavior.</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout the study we asked several questions to guide us. How does the listener’s environment affect gesture use? Do gestures make it easier to learn how to use the app? Is the gesture experience consistent across devices and operating systems or has Spotify adapted to each platform?</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout our study we strove to be data-informed. This is why we placed such an emphasis on getting feedback from listeners of the app and watching them actually use Spotify.</p>
<br>
<p>Through this study we hope to have a better understanding of gestures and how we can better implement them in the digital products we design.</p>
</div>
  
<div id="conceptModel">
   <h1>Concept Model</h1>
</div>

<div id="conceptModelText">
<p>We decided to make a concept model to help us narrow the scope of our gesture study and understand Spotify better. We went to the white board and started with the sentence, “People listen to music on Spotify.”</p>
<br>
<p>From there we started asking the questions; who, what, where, why, when, and how. We organized nouns based around each question. In this way we were able to get a good feel for the scope of Spotify.</p>

<br>
<p>From our white board concept model, J.J. Tenney created a vectorized version of it.</p>

<div id="gestureCatalog">
   <h1>Gesture Catalog</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureCatalogText">
<p>To make our gesture catalog we first looked up both Android and iOS gestures from both the Google and Apple design guideline websites.</p>
<br>
<p>We then each went through Spotify trying to find as many of the gestures we could. We came together and compiled a list of gestures within Spotify for each operating system. Then Camron Sackett created a vectorized version of the list with icons for each gesture.</p>

<div id="persona">
   <h1>Personas</h1>
</div>

<div id="personaText">
<p>We determined that our target audience is mostly college students. 72% of Spotify listeners are Millennials. Regarding the use of gestures, Millennials grew up with mobile devices and are used to touch based navigation and interfaces.</p>
<br>
<p>We based our target audience assessment on Spotify’s marketing packet that is available from their website. Spotify uses this packet to try and encourage content creators to bring their content to Spotify.</p>
<br>
<p>Knowing that the primary listener to Spotify is a young, college student, we decided to create personas to match this demographic.  J.J. Tenney created the personas.</p>

<p>For the listener testing, we wanted to see how gestures would affect the usage of both paid and free accounts. To get a good sense of how gestures either positively or negatively impacted the experiences of listeners, our task list asked for the creation of a playlist, using both known and unknown songs. Listeners were also asked to re-order, rename, and finally share the playlist.</p>
<br>
<p>Interviews were conducted on a college campus as the target audience / persona is a college aged student. Testing started out by screening for only those who actively used Spotify.</p>
<br>
<p>Of listeners tested, no one used Spotify on a tablet. Everyone used the phone app, with almost half also having used the desktop application. For phone operating system, Android vs. iOS split was 50%, with half of the listeners on one and half on the other.</p>
<br>
<p>The majority of testers were paid subscription accounts, with less than half using a free account. Use at home was the most popular environment, with car and school coming in second tied.</p>
<br>
<p>All listeners, except one free account, knew how to create a playlist and add songs they liked to it. Only half the listeners knew how to add a new or unknown song to the newly created playlist, as well as re-ordering, renaming, and sharing the playlist. This was across both paid and free listeners, though more paid listeners knew these actions than free listeners.</p>
<br>
<p>The top frustration from listeners, if there was one, many listeners did not have a frustration to give, was the ordering and renaming of playlists. Only one of the three free listeners complained about ads as a frustration. Two of the three free listeners had experienced hitting the max “6 skips per hour” limit of the account.</p>
<br>
<p>Half of the listeners discovered new music through external channels, either radio or friends. The other half of listeners used the discover features within the Spotify app. One of our testers utilized the “recommended songs” inside of the playlist itself to add new songs.</p>
<br>
<p>None of our listeners used the sharing function with friends or family to swap playlists. Only a few had more than 10 playlists, with the majority have 5 or less.</p>
<br>
<p>Since gestures are required to used the application on the phone, listeners were asked if they were aware of the gestures used and if they impacted positively or negatively enjoyment of Spotify. A little more than half the listeners said gestures affected their enjoyment and usage of the Spotify app, while the other listeners didn’t notice.</p>
<br>
<p>None of the free account listeners were aware that certain gestures were locked behind a premium subscription. This is understandable as the feature (such as the quick add) is not explicitly shown during an on-boarding process, but instead shown only if it is attempted.</p>

<div id="journeyMapSketch">
   <h1>Journey Map</h1>
</div>

<div id="journeyMapText">
<p>One of our most important deliverables in our gesture study was the creation of a journey map. A journey map is the path a user takes when interacting with a product. It is meant to show highlights, frustrations, and thoughts a user might encounter as they interact with a product.</p>
<br>
<p>Our journey map went through many iterations over the course of the study. Here is one iteration we developed on the white board. Some key things we wanted to focus on were the listener’s emotions, and specific gestures usability, and discoverability.</p>
<br>
<p>Our earlier iterations were very granular which helped us have a solid understanding of the specific gestures used through the journey. Our final version, on the next page, was less granular but it followed the process we used in our listener testing. Cam Sackett and Eric Doxey created the final version of the journey map.</p>

<div id="conclusion">
   <h1>Conclusion</h1>
</div>

<div id="conclusionText">
<p>We reached some surprising conclusions through our listener testing. Our team thought that there would be a lot of gestures that the Spotify team had implemented in the app but listeners would have trouble finding. Through testing we found an opposite problem.</p>
<br>
<p>Listeners were expecting certain gestures for some tasks but they weren’t present. One specific instance we found is when a listener wanted to change a playlist name, they expected to be able to just tap on the name itself. They actually had to go to the menu and tap edit instead.</p>
<br>
<p>Another gesture listeners expected to be able to do was to drag and drop a song to rearrange the playlist. For this task the listener also had to go to the menu to make this change. We think the listener experience could be improved if listeners could long press and drag songs to reorder them in the playlist.</p>
<br>
<p>An additional problem we discovered relates to affordances between free and premium listeners. One premium gesture Spotify has is a swipe for a listener to quickly add a song to a playlist. Someone that we tested who has a free account tried to do this swipe and became confused as to why it didn’t work. When we asked them about it they said their friend has a premium account and they had seen them do a swipe to add a song.</p>
<br>
<p>They didn’t realize it was a premium gesture. Spotify could improve their experience by giving the listener a notification every time they tried to use that gesture in that manner.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, Spotify does an excellent job with gesture controls. Through this study we all have a deeper appreciation for gesture controls. Most of us hadn’t thought too deeply about gestures in the apps we use because they are usually second nature. By doing this deep-dive investigation into gesture usage within Spotify, I believe we will all be better designers because of it.</p>
