   <h1>Breaking Down The Journey</h1>
</div>

<div id="introText">
   <p>Spotify is the world’s largest ad-supported streaming music service. As of June 2017, there are over 140 million active listeners listening to a database of over 30 million songs across 60 countries. Mobile devices are the most common platform for listeners to access Spotify at 52% of the overall use (Spotify Media Kit 2018). With this increasing reliance on the mobile platform it is crucial that Spotify succeeds at presenting an exceptional experience for listeners.</p>
<br>
<p>Spotify listeners access the service from morning to night. Listeners use their mobile device, personal computer or connected device as they go through their morning routine, commute throughout the day, work, study at school, run errands, play or party on the weekends, and wind down each night. Every one of these uses presents a different scenario of environment and behavior.</p>
<br />
<p>With the average listener accessing the app for more than two hours each day, it is expected that they become familiar with the app and expect smooth interactions. Gestures play a large role in achieving this familiarity and effortless interactions.</p>
<br />
<p>With a wide variety of options, there are specific gestures in Spotify which represent customer actions. Through a careful study of use case scenarios and research, our goal as a research team was to determine if the gestures in the Spotify app are effective and provide an excellent customer experience.</p>
</div>


<div id="gestureIntro">
   <h1>Gesture Study Introduction</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureIntroText">
<p>During our exploration of the Spotify mobile app, we determined how the app utilizes gestures.</p>
<br>
<p>We wanted to know if Spotify implements gestures appropriately, whether they are easily discoverable, and if these gestures truly enhance the listener’s experience. We also provided suggestions on ways Spotify can improve its implementation of gestures.</p>
<br>
<p>Gestures within Spotify change how the listener interacts with the application and their music. Gestures are an essential component for navigating through Spotify and accomplishing the listener’s needs. Understanding how gestures affect usage are of the utmost importance because it influences the Information Architecture of the application.</p>
<br>
<p>By doing this deep-dive study into gestures, we hope to be able to design better mobile applications, websites, and other digital products that take advantage of touch screens in the future.</p>
</div>
  

<div id="gestureProcess">
   <h1>Gesture Study Process</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureProcessText">
<p>We conducted our research through a few different phases. We started by doing some discovery research through individual use, notating our findings. After becoming more familiar with the mobile app on our personal devices we discussed our findings with each other and did a group study on the provided flagship devices, the iPhone 8 and the Pixel 2.</p>
<br>
<p>We examined the similarities and differences between not only the devices but the operating systems as well. During this comparison we took inventory of all the gestures that Spotify uses on the platforms we tested.</p>
<p>The next step in our research study was to run through some use cases and document our findings. We created three use cases:</p>
<br>
<ul class="gestureLists">
<li>listener creates a playlist</li>
<li>listener edits a playlist</li>
<li>listener shares a playlist</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p>Through our process we came up with several deliverables. Although it was a team effort, each deliverable had specific people ultimately responsible for them. The list of deliverables and their owners is as follows:</p>
<br>

   <h1>Goals of Study</h1>
</div>

<div id="studyGoalsText">
<p>We think that gestures can help listeners efficiently perform tasks and that they should enhance their musical experience. We set out to determine whether Spotify implements gestures appropriately, whether they are easily discoverable, and if these gestures truly enhance the listener’s experience.</p>
<br>
<p>We predicted that gestures do enhance the experience, many gestures within Spotify are not easily discoverable, and Spotify could implement gestures better in certain places within their app.</p>
<br>
<p>With this study we also wanted to understand how gestures affect the usage of the application and how gestures affect listener behavior.</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout the study we asked several questions to guide us. How does the listener’s environment affect gesture use? Do gestures make it easier to learn how to use the app? Is the gesture experience consistent across devices and operating systems or has Spotify adapted to each platform?</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout our study we strove to be data-informed. This is why we placed such an emphasis on getting feedback from listeners of the app and watching them actually use Spotify.</p>
<br>
<p>Through this study we hope to have a better understanding of gestures and how we can better implement them in the digital products we design.</p>
</div>
  
<div id="conceptModel">
   <h1>Concept Model</h1>
</div>

<div id="conceptModelText">
<p>We decided to make a concept model to help us narrow the scope of our gesture study and understand Spotify better. We went to the white board and started with the sentence, “People listen to music on Spotify.”</p>
<br>
<p>From there we started asking the questions; who, what, where, why, when, and how. We organized nouns based around each question. In this way we were able to get a good feel for the scope of Spotify.</p>
</div>

 <div id="conceptModel2">
   <h1>Concept Model</h1>
</div>

<div id="conceptModelText2">
<br>
<p>From our white board concept model, J.J. Tenney created a vectorized version of it.</p>
</div>
 
<div id="gestureCatalog">
   <h1>Gesture Catalog</h1>
</div>

<div id="gestureCatalogText">
<p>To make our gesture catalog we first looked up both Android and iOS gestures from both the Google and Apple design guideline websites.</p>
<br>
<p>We then each went through Spotify trying to find as many of the gestures we could. We came together and compiled a list of gestures within Spotify for each operating system.</p>

<div id="persona">
   <h1>Persona</h1>
</div>

<div id="personaText">
<p>We determined that our target audience is mostly college students. 72% of Spotify listeners are Millennials. Regarding the use of gestures, Millennials grew up with mobile devices and are used to touch based navigation and interfaces.</p>
<br>
<p>We based our target audience assessment on Spotify’s marketing packet that is available from their website. Spotify uses this packet to try and encourage content creators to bring their content to Spotify.</p>
<br>
<p>Knowing that the primary listener to Spotify is a young, college student, we decided to create a persona to match this demographic. J.J. Tenney created the persona on the following page.</p>
